# HeroesApp

## Overview

This is an app that uses `react-router-dom` and `create-react-app`. Here you have two pages where you can visualize heroes from Marvel and Dc, and it also there is a page with a search bar where you can look for any hero in the website, this is done thanks to `query-string`. You can navegate through this pages with a Navbar and it doesn't refresh the website. 

There are two routers, one in the login form (which it's not a login, it's just a button), and if you don't click the button in this login, you can't go to any page on the website through any url. The other router is in the navbar.
